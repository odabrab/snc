README

As of 2016, Simple Network Communicator stands as a didactic project for UNIX Berkeley Sockets.
Directory "doc/" shelters project's documentation.
Application seeks to be minimal. Thus, communication is elegantly implemented in a peer-to-peer fashion. Two classes only: SimpleNetworkCommunicator, which holds the main() method, and Peer. And that is it.
